### Hello, I'm Shrikant Angadi 👋

I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and making an impact through creative solutions. 
Here's a glimpse into my journey:  


## 🛠 Projects
Hospital Management system
OVERVIEW:

Hospital Management System (HMS) Overview:
Purpose: Automates hospital operations (patient management, appointments, billing, inventory).
Modular Design: Separate modules for different functions (e.g., patient records, staff management).
Database: Stores and manages hospital data securely (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB).
Key Features:
Appointment Scheduling: Optimized using algorithms (e.g., greedy, priority).
Billing and Payments: Algorithms for cost calculation, discounts, and payment processing.
Medical Records: Efficient data retrieval with search algorithms (e.g., binary search, hashing).
System Design:
Efficiency: Optimized database queries, caching, and load balancing.
Security: Data encryption, authentication, and access control.
Scalability: Cloud-based or distributed systems to handle growth.
Usability: User-friendly interfaces for hospital staff and patients.
Challenges:
Data Accuracy: Ensuring correct patient and medical information.
Interoperability: Integration with other healthcare systems.
Real-Time Processing: Handling critical patient data in real-time.
Benefits:
Improves hospital operations.
Enhances patient care.
Reduces operational costs.
Technical Stack: Languages: C++, Java Algorithms: Dijkstra’s, A*, KMP, Chain Hashing, Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS) Tools: Graphs, DAA Optimization Techniques

Impact:

Impacts of a Hospital Management System (HMS)
Improved Efficiency: Automates tasks, speeds up data retrieval, and reduces manual work.
Enhanced Patient Care: Quick access to accurate patient information and better scheduling.
Cost Reduction: Optimizes resources, reduces administrative overheads, and minimizes wastage.
Data Security: Ensures compliance with regulations and protects patient data.
Better Decision-Making: Supports data-driven decisions and improves hospital planning.
Scalability: Grows with the hospital, adaptable to new locations and services.
Enhanced Communication: Improves coordination among staff and with patients.
Operational Transparency: Provides performance metrics for better accountability.
Error Reduction: Minimizes human error in patient records, prescriptions, and billing.
